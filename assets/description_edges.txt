Edge Detection is a crucial technique in image processing that identifies and highlights the boundaries of objects within an image. This process is essential for various applications such as object recognition, image segmentation, and feature extraction. 
One prominent method for edge detection is the Sobel Edge Detection technique, which utilizes convolutional filters to calculate the gradient of image intensity at each pixel. The Sobel operator applies two distinct filters—one for detecting changes in the horizontal direction (Gx) and one for the vertical direction (Gy). By combining these gradients, Sobel edge detection effectively highlights areas with significant intensity changes, marking the edges of objects. This method is particularly valued for its simplicity and effectiveness in emphasizing the structural details of an image, making it a popular choice in both academic research and practical applications. The Sobel technique is robust to noise and provides clear edge representation, aiding in further image analysis.

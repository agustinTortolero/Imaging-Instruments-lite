A median filter is a non-linear image processing technique used to reduce noise while preserving edges. It works by replacing each pixel's value with the median value of its surrounding pixels within a defined window. This method is particularly effective for removing salt and pepper noise, which consists of random black and white pixels scattered throughout the image. Unlike linear filters, the median filter maintains sharpness and detail by not blurring edges, making it suitable for tasks where preserving image features is crucial. By focusing on the central value in a sorted list of pixel intensities, it smooths out noise while keeping important image structures intact.
